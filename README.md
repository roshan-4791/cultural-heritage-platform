# Cultural Heritage Preservation Platform

## Overview
This project aims to preserve the cultural heritage of local communities by documenting stories, folk tales, recipes, songs, traditions, and life experiences shared by village elders. Students conduct recorded interviews, and these videos are organized, categorized, and showcased through a dedicated YouTube channel with subtitles. The website acts as a simple and accessible digital archive for exploring all collected stories.

## Objectives
- Preserve local heritage by documenting oral traditions.
- Encourage student participation in community-based storytelling.
- Publish interviews on YouTube with subtitles in multiple languages.
- Provide an accessible digital archive for all stories.
- Strengthen connections between younger and older generations.
